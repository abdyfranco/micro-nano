# Micro Nano Framework
**Micro Nano Framework** â€“  A very simple, light, small and useless database-less
MVC framework for PHP.

Micro Nano Framewok is an extremely lightweight, object oriented MVC PHP framework.
Its requirements are basic: PHP 5.6 or better and only that! There is no other
requirement - making it very easy to deploy in a wide array of environments.

Micro Nano Framework does not include support for any type of database by default,
but offers data storage through "Models" that store data in multiple JSON files
in the file system.

Although by default no database support is included, you can always make use of
the PDO class that comes integrated in PHP or some external library!

Micro Nano Framework gives you the flexibility and freedom to choose the database
engine and libraries to use as it includes absolutely none!

## How do I know if Micro Nano Framework is for me?
Micro Nano Framework is for you if you want everything and nothing at the same time!
All the power of an object-oriented framework and at the same time no power at all,
available at your fingertips!

## What kind of framework is it?
Supposedly it's an object-oriented framework with Model-View-Controller pattern,
but it can be anything you want! (Or whatever he wants, according to his mood) 

## Is this framework really useless?
Probably not! This framework can be very useful for testing PHP classes, or
prototyping dynamic websites quickly that do not require a complex and heavy
framework (or a database). Although we don't really know the truth, it may or may
not be useful.
